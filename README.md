# POC-ST

## Overview

POC-ST is a Proof of Concept (PoC) project by Ghaith Saidani, hosted on GitHub. This repository appears to be a minimal or newly initialized project, potentially focused on STM32Programingtool. As a prototype, it aims to demonstrate core concepts in a simple, reproducible manner. If this is an early-stage repo, it may serve as a foundation for more extensive development.

For more details, explore the repository files or contact the author.

## Features

- **Lightweight Setup**: Minimal dependencies for quick prototyping.
- **Extensible Structure**: Designed for easy addition of modules or tests.
- [Add features based on actual code, e.g., "Token-based security implementation"].
- **Version Control Ready**: Uses Git for collaborative development.

## Prerequisites

- Git (for cloning).
- [Specify based on language, e.g., Node.js v18+ or Python 3.10+].
